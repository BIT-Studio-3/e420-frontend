# Main Web App Page 

The main page will house the front end of the game, and will be used to navigate the page(s),

# Seconary Page 

this page will house the controls and commands list, as well as a small display of your agent (player character)

## Svelte Kit Code 

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
